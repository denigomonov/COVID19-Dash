# COVID19-Dash

## Project Goal:
I had multiple goals established that I wanted to achieve developing **COVID19-Dash** project. First, it was important to raise the awarness on the impact caused by ongoing pandemic in U.S. by visualizing distribution of *cases* & *deaths* and highlighting precautionary measures to stay safe and help prevent the spread of this illness. Second, I wanted to push myself further with learning more about posabilities of Plotly library and creating customized vizualizations, each tailored to tell a story and allow viewer to interact with it. Lastly, to deploy a final product in a form of a Dashboard App that can be used in a professional world by researchers, analytics, and clients.
