# COVID19-Dash

## Project Goal:
I had multiple goals established that I wanted to achieve developing **COVID19-Dash** project. First, it was important to raise the awareness on the impact caused by ongoing pandemic in U.S. by visualizing distribution of *cases* & *deaths* and highlighting precautionary measures to stay safe and help prevent the spread of this illness. Second, I wanted to push myself further with learning more about possibilities of Plotly library and creating customized visualizations, each tailored to tell a story and allow viewer to interact with it. Lastly, to deploy a final product in a form of a Dashboard App that can be used in a professional world by researchers, analytics, and clients.

## Covid-19 Data:
For the development of this project I had to make sure that I'll be retrieving data from a trustworthy source - [USAFACTS](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/). USAFacts is a not-for-profit, nonpartisan civic initiative providing the most comprehensive and understandable single source of government data and trusted by [Feeding America](https://www.feedingamerica.org/), [MiT](https://www.mit.edu/), Google and many more.
